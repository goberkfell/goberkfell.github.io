		<p>The Atlanta Hawks have a young roster chocked to the brim with emerging talent and potential stars that could take over the NBA in only a few years.</p>

		<h2>Trae Young</h2>
		<p>The shooter extraordinaire and instinctive floor general, Trae Young, has shown in his only college season at Oklahoma as well as the few games this 2018-2019 season that he is capable of making the switch to the pros. Coming out recently with a 35 point &amp; 11 assist game, Young has shown slight sparks of the player he can become with only a few more years under his belt. More of his stats can be viewed <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/y/youngtr01.html">here</a>. </p>

		<h2>John Collins</h2>

		<p>One of the most athletic forwards coming into the league in the past few years, has shown strides towards becoming a fundamental player that can not only show out with highlight dunks, but also put the ball on the floor and take it to the hole as well as be a threat from behind the three-point line. The tandem that is forming between Young and Collins is electric, as many lobs have been thrown to Collins from Young which have brought the Atlanta crowds to a standing ovation.</p>
